# cpp-tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe made in c++ using the Vector library.

# How it works

The first player (X) plays against another person, who will be (O). The numbers on the keyboard represent the positions in the game (Example: 9 is the top left box, 5 is the middle box, etc.).

Whoever makes a combination of three symbols in a row vertically, horizontally or crossed wins. The code does not allow both players to play in the same position.

If neither player makes any combination before filling the nine positions, it will be considered a draw.
